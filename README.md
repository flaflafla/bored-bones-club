create a file `public/config.json` and add the following, along with the appropriate values:

```
{
    "merkleData": [],
    "contractAddress": "",
    "infuraId": "",
    "networkId": 1
}
```

`merkleData` items should be addresses followed by two zeros, eg `0xc730b028da66ebb14f20e67c68dd809fbc49890d00` instead of `0xc730b028da66ebb14f20e67c68dd809fbc49890d`

to run locally:

```
yarn
yarn start
```
